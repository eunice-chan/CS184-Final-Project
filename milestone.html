<!--
This should be about 1 page long if printed. You should briefly summarize what you have accomplished, preliminary results, reflect on progress relative to your plan, and update your work plan as appropriate.

<p>It has been a week since I started this project, meaning I am now at the halfway point of the project. I will now take a step back and assess my current progress.</p>

<h2>Achievements and Preliminary Results</h2>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>I went through three iterations of model-creation because of the various challenges I faced.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Blender model ( attempted to export and import as .GLTF and .OBJ )</li>
  <li>Three.js geometry primitive with shaping done by scaling the bones</li>
  <li>Three.js geometry primitive with position calculated and set manually</li>
</ol>
<br />

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>I implemented the interactive demo interface. Currently, the demo only has forward kinematics and a moveable target.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>I started working on an IK method. However, while working on it, I realized I needed more helper functions (such as the calculation of a child element's new position once a set of rotations and translations are applied to the armature of its parents without actually applying the rotations) so I had to take a detour to work on that. I think the first method would take the longest to implement due to such detours. Once I get that done, the rest would probably not take as long.</p>
<p>I think I would be able to get through the other two IK method goals. However, regarding stylizing it, I would need to do some more research about how to stylize and that may be a little difficult to do.</p>

<h2>Work Plan Updates</h2>
<p>The most updated version of the work plan is <a href="./proposal.html#schedule">here</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>The <a href="./proposal.html#changelog">changes</a> I have made to the plan are:</p>
<p class="highlight-red_background"><i>August 2 Update</i>: Made forward kinematics a goal. </p>
<p class="highlight-orange_background"><i>August 4 Update</i>: Made SMCM a [goal] and moved the two models to [reach goal]. </p>
