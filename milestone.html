<!--
This should be about 1 page long if printed. You should briefly summarize what you have accomplished, preliminary results, reflect on progress relative to your plan, and update your work plan as appropriate.

It has been a week since I started this project, meaning I am now at the halfway point of the project. I will now take a step back and assess my current progress.

<h2>Achievements and Preliminary Results</h2>
<h3>Model</h3>
I went through three iterations of model-creation because of the various challenges I faced.
<br />
<ol>
  <li>Blender model ( attempted to export and import as .GLTF and .OBJ )</li>
  <li>Three.js geometry primitive with shaping done by scaling the bones</li>
  <li>Three.js geometry primitive with position calculated and set manually</li>
</ol>
<br />

<h3>Demo</h3>
I implemented the interactive demo interface. Currently, the demo only has forward kinematics.

<h2>Progress</h2>
I have managed to achieve everything I have set out to do so my current progress is exactly as planned.
<h2>Work Plan Updates</h2>
The most updated version of the work plan is <a href="./proposal.html">here</a>.

<br />
The changes I have made to the plan are:
